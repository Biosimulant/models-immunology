# Modeling the relevance of immune and metabolic cues in the macrophage/fibroblast interplay during fibrosis applied to kidney transplantation

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2209160001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Josue Manik Nava-Sedeño; Elisa Setten; Alessandra Castagna; Jonathan Weber; Roberta Carriero

## Description

In this model, we integrate in vitro observations of macrophage/fibroblasts in coculture with hypoxia and inflammatory signals. We obtain conditions under which the wound healing process progresses no


## Usage
