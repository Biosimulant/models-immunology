**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Dong, Y.; Miyazaki, R.; Takeuchi, Y.

## Description

This model gives a mathematical description of the interactions between tumor cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T cells (HTCs) within the tumor microenvironment, with emphasis on the role play


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
