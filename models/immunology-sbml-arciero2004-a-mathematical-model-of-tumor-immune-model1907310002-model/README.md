**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1907310002)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Arciero, J.C.; Jackson, T.L.; Kirschner, D.E.

## Description

This is a mathematical model consisting of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing tumor cells and immune effectors, as well as the immuno-stimulatory and suppressive cytokine


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
