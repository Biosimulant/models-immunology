# Lopez2014 - A Validated Mathematical Model of Tumor Growth Including Tumor-Host Interaction and Cell-Mediated Immune Response

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000784)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Alvaro G López; Jesús M Seoane; Miguel A F Sanjuán

## Description

This is a dynamical model of cancer growth that includes three interacting cell populations of tumor cells, healthy host cells and immune effector cells. The tumor-immune and the tumor-host interactio


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
