# Alvarez2019 - A nonlinear mathematical model of cell-mediated immune response for tumor phenotypic heterogeneity

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000790)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Robinson F Alvarez; José A M Barbuto; Roberto Venegeroles

## Description

This is a non-linear mathematical model of cancer immunosurveillance that takes into account intratumoral phenotypic heterogeneity, such as differential expression of cell surface receptors and growth


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
