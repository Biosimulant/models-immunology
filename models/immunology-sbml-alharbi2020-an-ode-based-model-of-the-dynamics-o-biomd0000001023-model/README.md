**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Sana Abdulkream Alharbi; Azmin Sham Rambely

## Description

This ordinary differential equation model of tumor cell growth, called the normal-tumor-immune-unhealthy diet model (NTIUNHDM), is described by the publication:Alharbi, S.A.; Rambely, A.S.'A New ODE-B


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
