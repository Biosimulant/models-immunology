# Chrobak2011 - A mathematical model of induced cancer-adaptive immune system competition

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000815)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Chrobak, J.M.; Herrero, H.

## Description

This is a mathematical model describing competition between an artificially induced tumor and the adaptive immune system based on the use of an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations.


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
