**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000001073)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Andrew Patterson; Noam Auslander

## Description

A Random Forest model is developed to incorporate tumor mutation data within the context of the biological process known as leukocyte proliferation regulation. This model aims to predict a patient's r
