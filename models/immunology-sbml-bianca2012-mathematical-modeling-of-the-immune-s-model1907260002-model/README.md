**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Carlo Bianca; Ferdinando Chiacchio; Francesco Pappalardo; Marzio Pennisi

## Description

This model describes the humoral and cellular response of the immune system to a tumor associate antigen and the recognition process between B cells, T cells and antigen presenting cells. The model is
