# Immunological Healthy State Model of Sphingolipids with IL-6/IL-17/IL-23 immune axis in L.major infection

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2301110002)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Diksha Jawale; Shweta Khandibharad; Shailza Singh

## Description

In Healthy State, we demonstrated the controlled expression of sphingolipids and the controlled IL-6,IL-17,IL-23 cytokines signalling via SOCS3 mediated regulation.


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
