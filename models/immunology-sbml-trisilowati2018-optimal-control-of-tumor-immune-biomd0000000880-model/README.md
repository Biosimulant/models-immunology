# Trisilowati2018 - Optimal control of tumor-immune system interaction with treatment

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000880)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Trisilowati, T.

## Description

This is a mathematical model of a growing tumor and its interaction with the immune system. The model consists of four populations: tumor cells, dendritic cells (representing the innate immune system)


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
