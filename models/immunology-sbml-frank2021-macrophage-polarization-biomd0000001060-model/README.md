**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000001060)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Frank AS; Larripa K; Ryu H; Snodgrass RG; Röblitz S

## Description

The model describes the mechanisms by which macrophages differentiate into a given phenotype. The model shows that both extracellular and intracellular signalling are both important for that process. 


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
