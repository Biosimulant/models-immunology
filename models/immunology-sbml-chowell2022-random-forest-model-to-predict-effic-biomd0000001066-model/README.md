**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Diego Chowell; Seong-Keun Yoo; Cristina Valero; Alessandro Pastore; Chirag Krishna

## Description

This is a Random Forest algorithm-based machine learning model called RF16, which incorporates a total of 16 genomic, molecular, demographic, and clinical features to predict the immunotherapy respons


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
