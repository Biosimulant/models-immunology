# Space Prompt - immunology-general-combo-0053

Create a scientifically coherent **immunology / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: immunology-sbml-scharf2023-holistic-view-on-the-structure-of-imm-model2304260001-model, immunology-sbml-schokker2013-a-mathematical-model-representing-c-biomd0000000895-model, immunology-sbml-shin2019-regulation-of-nuclear-factor-of-activat-model2003200002-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
