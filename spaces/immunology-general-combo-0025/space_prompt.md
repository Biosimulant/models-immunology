# Space Prompt - immunology-general-combo-0025

Create a scientifically coherent **immunology / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: immunology-sbml-chrobak2011-a-mathematical-model-of-induced-canc-biomd0000000815-model, immunology-sbml-coulibaly2019-interleukin-15-signaling-in-hif-1a-biomd0000000867-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
