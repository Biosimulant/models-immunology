# Space Prompt - immunology-adaptive-immunity-combo-0006

Create a scientifically coherent **immunology / adaptive_immunity** comparative space using:
- Base models: immunology-sbml-hoffman2018-adcc-against-cancer-biomd0000000802-model, immunology-sbml-kong2022-conditional-antibody-design-as-3d-equiv-biomd0000001070-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
