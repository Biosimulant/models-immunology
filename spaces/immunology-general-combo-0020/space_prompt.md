# Space Prompt - immunology-general-combo-0020

Create a scientifically coherent **immunology / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: immunology-sbml-banerjee2008-immunotherapy-with-interleukin-2-a-model2001130001-model, immunology-sbml-banerjee2015-a-mathematical-model-to-elucidate-b-model1912090003-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
